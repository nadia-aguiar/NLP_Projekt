Negro\\'s universal mimicry is not so much a thing in itself as an evidence of something that permeates his entire self. And that thing is drama.\\n\\nHis very words are action words. His interpretation of the English language is in terms of pictures. One act described in terms of another. Hence the rich metaphor and simile.\\n\\nThe metaphor is of course very primitive. It is easier to illustrate than it is to explain because action came before speech. Let us make a parallel. Language is like money. In primitive communities actual goods, however bulky, are bartered for what one wants. This finally evolves into coin, the coin being not real wealth but a symbol of wealth. Still later even coin is abandoned for legal tender, and still later for cheques in certain usages.\\n\\nEvery phase of Negro life is highly dramatised. No matter how joyful or how sad the case there is sufficient poise for drama. Every\\xadthing is acted out. Unconsciously for the most part of course. There is an impromptu ceremony always ready for every hour of life. No little moment passes unadorned.\\n\\nNow the people with highly developed languages have words for detached ideas. That is legal tender. \"That-which-we-squat-on\" has become \"chair.\" \"Groan-causer\" has evolved into \"spear,\" and so on. Some individuals even conceive of the equivalent of cheque words, like \"ideation\" and \"pleonastic.\" Perhaps we might say that Paradise Lost and Sartor Resartus are written in cheque words.\\n\\nThe primitive man exchanges descriptive words. His terms are all close fitting. Frequently the Negro, even with detached words in his vocabulary--not evolved in him but transplanted on his tongue by contact--must add action to it to make it do. So we have \"chop-axe,\" \"sitting-chair,\" \"cook-pot\" and the like because the speaker has in his mind the picture of the object in use. Action. Everything illustrated. So we can say the white man thinks in a written language and the Negro thinks in hieroglyphics.\\nA bit of Negro drama familiar to all is the frequent meeting of two opponents who threaten to do atrocious murder one upon the other.\\nWho has not observed a robust young Negro chap posing upon a street corner, possessed of nothing but his clothing, his strength and his youth? Does he bear himself like a pauper? No, Louis XIV could be no more insolent in his assurance. His eyes say plainly \"Female, halt!\" His posture exults \"Ah, female, I am the eternal male, the giver of life. Behold in my hot flesh all the delights of this world. Salute me, I am strength.\" All this with a languid posture, there is no mistaking his meaning.\\n\\nA Negro girl strolls past the corner lounger. Her whole body panging* [* from \"pang\"] and posing. A slight shoulder movement that calls attention to her bust, that is all of a dare. A hippy undulation below the waist that is a sheaf of promises tied with conscious power. She is acting out \"I\\'m a darned sweet woman and you know it.\"\\nThese little plays by strolling players are acted out daily in a dozen streets in a thousand cities, and no one ever mistakes the meaning.\\n\\n[Will to Adorn]\\n\\nThe will to adorn is the second most notable characteristic in Negro expression. Perhaps his idea of ornament does not attempt to meet conventional standards, but it satisfies the soul of its creator.\\nIn this respect the American Negro has done wonders to the English language. It has often been stated by etymologists that the Negro has introduced no African words to the language. This is true, but it is equally true that he has made over a great part of the tongue to his liking and has had his revision accepted by the ruling class. No one listening to a Southern white man talk could deny this. Not only has he softened and toned down strongly consonanted words like \"aren\\'t \" to \"ain\\'t \" and the like, he has made new force words out of old feeble elements. Examples of this are \"ham-shanked,\" \"battle-hammed,\" \"double-teen,\" \"bodaciously,\" \"muffle-jawed.\"\\n\\nBut the Negro\\'s greatest contribution to the language is : (1) the use of metaphor and simile; (2) the use of the double descriptive; (3) the use of verbal nouns.\\n\\n1. Metaphor and Simile\\n\\nOne at a time, like lawyers going to heaven.\\nYou sho is propaganda.\\nSobbing hearted.\\nI\\'ll beat you till: (a) rope like okra, (b) slack like lime, (c) smell like onions.\\nFatal for naked.\\nKyting along.\\nThat\\'s a rope.\\nCloakers--deceivers.\\nRegular as pig-tracks.\\nMule blood--black molasses.\\nThat\\'s a lynch.\\nSyndicating--gossiping.\\nFlambeaux--cheap cafe (lighted by flambeaux).\\nTo put yo\\'self on de ladder.\\n\\n2. The Double Descriptive\\n\\nHigh-tall.\\nLittle-tee-ninchy (tiny).\\nLow-down.\\nTop-superior.\\nSham-polish.\\nLady-people.\\nKill-dead.\\nHot-boiling.\\nChop-axe.\\nSitting-chairs.\\nDe watch wall.\\nSpeedy-hurry.\\nMore great and more better.\\n3. Verbal Nouns\\n\\nShe features somebody I know.\\nFuneralize.\\nSense me into it.\\nPuts the shamery on him.\\n\\'Taint everybody you kin confidence.\\nI wouldn\\'t friend with her.\\nJooking--playing piano or guitar as it is done in Jook-houses (houses of ill-fame).\\nUglying away.\\nI wouldn\\'t scorn my name all up on you.\\nBookooing (beaucoup) around--showing off.\\nWon\\'t stand a broke.\\nShe won\\'t take a listen.\\nHe won\\'t stand straightening.\\nThat is such a compliment.\\nThat\\'s a lynch.\\n\\nThe stark, trimmed phrases of the Occident seem too bare for the voluptuous child of the sun, hence the adornment. It arises out of the same impulse as the wearing of jewelry and the making of sculpture--the urge to adorn.\\n\\nOn the walls of the homes of the average Negro one always finds a glut of gaudy calendars, wall pockets and advertising lithographs. The sophisticated white man or Negro would tolerate none of these, even if they bore a likeness to the Mona Lisa. No commercial art for decoration. Nor the calendar nor the advertisement spoils the picture for this lowly man. He sees the beauty in spite of the declaration of the Portland Cement Works or the butcher\\'s announcement. I saw in Mobile a room in which there was an over-stuffed mohair living-room suite, an imitation mahogany bed and chifferobe, a console victrola. The walls were gaily papered with Sunday supplements of the Mobile Register. There were seven calendars and three wall pockets. One of them was decorated with a lace doily. The mantel-shelf was covered with a scarf of deep home-made lace, looped up with a huge bow of pink crepe paper. Over the door was a huge lithograph showing the Treaty of Versailles being signed with a Waterman fountain pen.\\n\\nIt was grotesque, yes. But it indicated the desire for beauty. And decorating a decoration, as in the case of the doily on the gaudy wall pocket, did not seem out of place to the hostess. The feeling back of such an act is that there can never be enough of beauty, let alone too much. Perhaps she is right. We each have our standards of art, and thus are we all interested parties and so unfit to pass judgment upon the art concepts of others.\\n\\nWhatever the Negro does of his own volition he embellishes. His religious service is for the greater part excellent prose poetry. Both prayers and sermons are tooled and polished until they are true works of art. The supplication is forgotten in the frenzy of creation. The prayer of the white man is considered humorous in its bleakness. The beauty of the Old Testament does not exceed that of a Negro prayer.\\n[Angularity]\\n\\nAfter adornment the next most striking manifestation of the Negro is Angularity. Everything that he touches becomes angular. In all African sculpture and doctrine of any sort we find the same thing.\\n\\nAnyone watching Negro dancers will be struck by the same phenomenon. Every posture is another angle. Pleasing, yes. But an effect achieved by the very means which an European strives to avoid.\\n\\nThe pictures on the walls are hung at deep angles. Furniture is always set at an angle. I have instances of a piece of furniture in the middle of a wall being set with one end nearer the wall than the other to avoid the simple straight line.\\n\\n[Assymetry]\\n\\nAsymmetry is a definite feature of Negro art. I have no samples of true Negro painting unless we count the African shields, but the sculpture and carvings are full of this beauty and lack of symmetry.\\n\\nIt is present in the literature, both prose and verse. I offer an example of this quality in verse from Langston Hughes:\\n\\n\"I ain\\'t gonna mistreat ma good gal any more,\\nI\\'m just gonna kill her next time she makes me sore.\\n\\nI treats her kind but she don\\'t do me right,\\nShe fights and quarrels most ever\\' night.\\n\\nI can\\'t have no woman\\'s got such low-down ways\\nCause de blue gum woman ain\\'t de style now\\'days.\\n\\nI brought her from the South and she\\'s goin on back,\\nElse I\\'ll use her head for a carpet tack.\"\\n\\nIt is the lack of symmetry which makes Negro dancing so difficult for white dancers to learn. The abrupt and unexpected changes. The frequent change of key and time are evidences of this quality in music. (Note the St. Louis Blues.)\\n\\nThe dancing of the justly famous Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are excellent examples.\\n\\nThe presence of rhythm and lack of symmetry are paradoxical, but there they are. Both are present to a marked degree. There is always rhythm, but it is the rhythm of segments. Each unit has a rhythm of its own, but when the whole is assembled it is lacking in symmetry. But easily workable to a Negro who is accustomed to the break in going from one part to another, so that he adjusts himself to the new tempo.\\n\\n[Dancing]\\n\\nNegro dancing is dynamic suggestion. No matter how violent it may appear to the beholder, every posture gives the impression that the dancer will do much more. For example, the performer flexes one knee sharply, assumes a ferocious face mask, thrusts the upper part of the body forward with clenched fists, elbows taut as in hard running or grasping a thrusting blade. That is all. But the spectator himself adds the picture of ferocious assault, hears the drums and finds himself keeping time with the music and tensing himself for the struggle. It is compelling insinuation. That is the very reason the spectator is held so rapt. He is participating in the performance himself--carrying out the suggestions of the performer.\\n\\nThe difference in the two arts is : the white dancer attempts to express fully; the Negro is restrained, but succeeds in gripping the beholder by forcing him to finish the action the performer suggests. Since no art ever can express all the variations conceivable, the Negro must be considered the greater artist, his dancing is realistic suggestion, and that is about all a great artist can do.\\n\\n[Negro Folklore]\\n\\nNegro folklore is not a thing of the past. It is still in the making. Its great variety shows the adaptability of the black man: nothing is too old or too new, domestic or foreign, high or low, for his use. God and the Devil are paired, and are treated no more reverently than Rockefeller and Ford. Both of these men are prominent in folklore, Ford being particularly strong, and they talk and act like good\\xadnatured stevedores or mill-hands. Ole Massa is sometimes a smart man and often a fool. The auto\\xadmobile is ranged alongside of the oxcart. The angels and the apostles walk and talk like section hands. And through it all walks Jack, the greatest culture hero of the South; Jack beats them all--even the Devil, who is often smarter than God.\\n\\n[Culture Heroes]\\n\\nThe Devil is next after Jack as a culture hero. He can out-smart everyone but Jack. God is absolutely no match for him. He is good-natured and full of humour. The sort of person one may count on to help out in any difficulty.\\n\\nPeter the Apostle is the third in importance. One need not look far for the explanation. The Negro is not a Christian really. The primitive gods are not deities of too subtle inner reflection ; they are hard\\xadworking bodies who serve their devotees Just as laboriously as the suppliant serves them. Gods of physical violence, stopping at nothing to serve their followers. Now of all the apostles Peter is the most active. When the other ten fell back trembling in the garden, Peter wielded the blade on the posse. Peter first and foremost in all action. The gods of no peoples have been philosophic until the people themselves have approached that state.\\n\\nThe rabbit, the bear, the lion, the buzzard, the fox are culture heroes from the animal world. The rabbit is far in the lead of all the others and is blood brother to Jack. In short, the trickster-hero of West Africa has been transplanted to America.\\n\\nJohn Henry is a culture hero in song, but no more so than Stacker Lee, Smokey Joe or Bad Lazarus. There are many, many Negroes who have never heard of any of the song heroes, but none who do not know John (Jack) and the rabbit.\\n\\nExamples of Folklore and the Modern Culture Hero\\n\\nWhy de Porpoise\\'s Tail is on Crosswise\\n\\nNow, I want to tell you \\'bout de porpoise. God had done made de world and everything. He set de moon and de stars in de sky. He got de fishes of de sea, and de fowls of de air completed.\\n\\nHe made de sun and hung it up. Then He made a nice gold track for it to run on. Then He said, \"Now, Sun, I got everything made but Time. That\\'s up to you. I want you to start out and go round de world on dis track just as fast as you kin make it. And de time it takes you to go and come, I\\'m going to call day and night.\" De Sun went zoomin\\' on cross de elements. Now, de porpoise was hanging round there and heard God what he tole de Sun, so he decided he\\'d take dat trip round de world hisself. He looked up and saw de Sun kytin\\' along, so he lit out too, him and dat Sun!\\n\\nSo de porpoise beat de Sun round de world by one hour and three minutes. So God said, \"Aw naw, this ain\\'t gointer do! I didn\\'t mean for no thin\\' to be faster than de Sun!\" So God run dat porpoise for three days before he run him down and caught him, and took his tail off and put it on crossways to slow him up. Still he\\'s de fastest thing in de water.\\n\\nAnd dat\\'s why de porpoise got his tail on crossways.\\n\\nRockefeller and Ford\\n\\nOnce John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford was woofing at each other. Rockefeller told Henry Ford he could build a solid gold road round the world. Henry Ford told him if he would he would look at it and see if he liked it, and if he did he would buy it and put one of his tin lizzies on it.\\n\\n[Originality]\\n\\nIt has been said so often that the Negro is lacking in originality that it has almost become a gospel. Outward signs seem to bear this out. But if one looks closely its falsity is immediately evident.\\n\\nIt is obvious that to get back to original sources is much too difficultfor any group to claim very much as a certainty. What we really mean by originality is the modification of ideas. The most ardent admirer of the great Shakespeare cannot claim first source even for him. It is his treatment of the borrowed material.\\n\\nSo if we look at it squarely, the Negro is a very original being. While he lives and moves in the midst of a white civilisation, everything that he touches is re-interpreted for his own use. He has modified the language, mode of food preparation, practice of medicine, and most certainly the religion of his new country, just as he adapted to suit himself the Sheik hair-cut made famous by Rudolph Valentino.\\n\\nEveryone is familiar with the Negro\\'s modification of the whites\\' musical instruments, so that his interpretation has been adopted by the white man himself and then re-interpreted. In so many words, Paul Whiteman is giving an imitation of a Negro orchestra making use of white-invented musical instru\\xadments in a Negro way. Thus has arisen a new art in the civilised world, and thus has our so-called civilisation come. The exchange and re-exchange of ideas between groups.\\n\\n[Imitation]\\n\\nThe Negro, the world over, is famous as a mimic. But this in no way damages his standing as an original. Mimicry is an art in itself. If it is not, then all art must fall by the same blow that strikes it down. When sculpture, painting, acting, dancing, literature neither reflect nor suggest anything in nature or human experience we turn away with a dull wonder in our hearts at why the thing was done. Moreover, the contention that the Negro imitates from a feeling of inferiority is incorrect. He mimics for the love of it. The group of Negroes who slavishly imitate is small. The average Negro glories in his ways. The highly educated Negro the same. The self-despisement lies in a middle class who scorns to do or be anything Negro. \"That\\'s just like a Nigger\" is the most terrible rebuke one can lay upon this kind. He wears drab clothing, sits through a boresome church service, pretends to have no interest in the community, holds beauty contests, and otherwise apes all the mediocrities of the white brother. The truly cultured Negro scorns him, and the Negro \"farthest down\" is too busy \"spreading his junk\" in his own way to see or care. He likes his own things best. Even the group who are not Negroes but belong to the \"sixth race,\" buy such records as \"Shake dat thing\" and \"Tight lak dat.\" They really enjoy hearing a good bible-beater preach, but wild horses could drag no such admission from them. Their ready-made expression is : \"We done got away from all that now.\" Some refuse to countenance Negro music on the grounds that it is niggerism, and for that reason should be done away with. Roland Hayes was thoroughly denounced for singing spirituals until he was accepted by white audiences. Langston Hughes is not considered a poet by this group because he writes of the man in the ditch, who is more numerous and real among us than any other.\\n\\nBut, this group aside, let us say that the art of mimicry is better developed in the Negro than in other racial groups. He does it as the mocking-bird does it, for the love of it, and not because he wishes to be like the one imitated. I saw a group of small Negro boys imitating a cat defecating and the subsequent toilet of the cat. It was very realistic, and they enjoyed it as much as if they had been imitating a coronation ceremony. The dances are full of imitations of various animals. The buzzard lope, walking the dog, the pig\\'s hind legs, holding the mule, elephant squat, pigeon\\'s wing, falling off the log, seabord (imitation of an engine starting), and the like.\\n\\n[Absence of the Concept of Privacy]\\n\\nIt is said that Negroes keep nothing secret, that they have no reserve. This ought not to seem strange when one considers that we are an outdoor people accustomed to communal life. Add this to all\\xadpermeating drama and you have the explanation.\\n\\nThere is no privacy in an African village. Loves, fights, possessions are, to misquote Woodrow Wilson, \"Open disagreements openly arrived at.\" The community is given the benefit of a good fight as well as a good wedding. An audience is a necessary part of any drama. We merely go with nature rather than against it.\\n\\nDiscord is more natural than accord. If we accept the doctrine of the survival of the fittest there are more fighting honors than there are honors for other achievements. Humanity places premiums on all things necessary to its well-being, and a valiant and good fighter is valuable in any community. So why hide the light under a bushel? Moreover, intimidation is a recognised part of warfare the world over, and threats certainly must be listed under that head. So that a great threatener must certainly be con\\xadsidered an aid to the fighting machine. So then if a man or woman is a facile hurler of threats, why should he or she not show their wares to the community? Hence the holding of all quarrels and fights in the open. One relieves one\\'s pent-up anger and at the same time earns laurels in intimidation. Besides, one does the community a service. There is nothing so exhilarating as watching well-matched oppo\\xadnents go into action. The entire world likes action, for that matter. Hence prize-fighters become millionaires.\\n\\nLikewise love-making is a biological necessity the world over and an art among Negroes. So that a man or woman who is proficient sees no reason why the fact should not be moot. He swaggers. She struts hippily about. Songs are built on the power to charm beneath the bed-clothes. Here again we have individuals striving to excel in what the community considers an art. Then if all of his world is seeking a great lover, why should he not speak right out loud?\\n\\nIt is all in a view-point. Love-making and fighting in all their branches are high arts, other things are arts among other groups where they brag about their proficiency just as brazenly as we do about these things that others consider matters for conversation behind closed doors. At any rate, the white man is despised by Negroes as a very poor fighter individually, and a very poor lover. One Negro, speaking of white men, said, \"White folks is alright when dey gits in de bank and on de law bench, but dey sho\\' kin lie about wimmen folks.\"\\n\\nI pressed him to explain. \"Well you see, white mens makes out they marries wimmen to look at they eyes, and they know they gits em for just what us gits em for. \\'Nother thing, white mens say they goes clear round de world and wins all de wimmen folks way from they men folks. Dat\\'s a lie too. They don\\'t win nothin, they buys em. Now de way I figgers it, if a woman don\\'t want me enough to be wid me, \\'thout I got to pay her, she kin rock right on, but these here white men don\\'t know what to do wid a woman when they gits her--dat\\'s how come they gives they wimmen so much. They got to. Us wimmen works jus as hard as us does an come home an sleep wid us every night. They own wouldn\\'t do it and its de mens fault. Dese white men done fooled theyself bout dese wimmen.\\n\\n\"Now me, I keeps me some wimmens all de time. Dat\\'s whut dey wuz put here for--us mens to use. Dat\\'s right now, Miss. Y\\'all wuz put here so us mens could have some pleasure. Course I don\\'t run round like heap uh men folks. But if my ole lady go way from me and stay more\\'n two weeks, I got to git me somebody, ain\\'t I ?\"\\n\\n[The Jook]\\n\\nJook is the word for a Negro pleasure house. It may mean a bawdy house. It may mean the house set apart on public works where the men and women dance, drink and gamble. Often it is a combination of all these.\\n\\nIn past generations the music was furnished by \"boxes,\" another word for guitars. One guitar was enough for a dance; to have two was considered excellent. Where two were playing one man played the lead and the other seconded him. The first player was \"picking\" and the second was \"framming,\" that is, playing chords while the lead carried the melody by dexterous finger work. Sometimes a third player was added, and he played a tom-tom effect on the low strings. Believe it or not, this is excellent dance music.\\n\\nPianos soon came to take the place of the boxes, and now player-pianos and victrolas are in all of the Jooks.\\n\\nMusically speaking, the Jook is the most important place in America. For in its smelly, shoddy con\\xadfines has been born the secular music known as blues, and on blues has been founded jazz. The singing and playing in the true Negro style is called \"jooking.\"\\n\\nThe songs grow by incremental repetition as they travel from mouth to mouth and from Jook to Jook for years before they reach outside ears. Hence the great variety of subject-matter in each song.\\n\\nThe Negro dances circulated over the world were also conceived inside the Jooks. They too make the round of Jooks and public works before going into the outside world.\\n\\nIn this respect it is interesting to mention the Black Bottom. I have read several false accounts of its origin and name. One writer claimed that it got its name from the black sticky mud on the bottom of the Mississippi river. Other equally absurd statements gummed the press. Now the dance really originated in the Jook section of Nashville, Tennessee, around Fourth Avenue. This is a tough neighbourhood known as Black Bottom--hence the name.\\n\\nThe Charleston is perhaps forty years old, and was danced up and down the Atlantic seaboard from North Carolina to Key West, Florida.\\n\\nThe Negro social dance is slow and sensuous. The idea in the Jook is to gain sensation, and not so much exercise. So that just enough foot movement is added to keep the dancers on the floor. A tremendous sex stimulation is gained from this. But who is trying to avoid it? The man, the woman, the time and the place have met. Rather, little intimate names are indulged in to heap fire on fire.\\n\\nThese too have spread to all the world.\\n\\nThe Negro theatre, as built up by the Negro, is based on Jook situations, with women, gambling, fighting, drinking. Shows like \"Dixie to Broadway\" are only Negro in cast, and could just as well have come from pre-Soviet Russia.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing--Negro shows before being tampered with did not specialise in octoroon chorus girls. The girl who could hoist a Jook song from her belly and lam it against the front door of the theatre was the lead, even if she were as black as the hinges of hell. The question was \"Can she jook?\" She must also have a good belly wobble, and her hips must, to quote a popular work song, \"Shake like jelly all over and be so broad, Lawd, Lawd, and be so broad.\" So that the bleached chorus is the result of a white demand and not the Negro\\'s.\\n\\nThe woman in the Jook may be nappy headed and black, but if she is a good lover she gets there just the same. A favorite Jook song of the past has this to say:\\n\\nSinger : It ain\\'t good looks dat takes you through dis world.\\nAudience : What is it, good mama?\\nSinger: Elgin movements in your hips. Twenty years guarantee.\\n\\nAnd it always brought down the house too.\\n\\nOh de white gal rides in a Cadillac,\\nDe yaller gal rides de same,\\nBlack gal rides in a rusty Ford\\nBut she gits dere just de same.\\n\\nThe sort of woman her men idealise is the type that is put forth in the theatre. The art-creating Negro prefers a not too thin woman,who can shake like jelly all over as she dances and sings, and that is the type he put forth on the stage. She has been banished by the white producer and the Negro who takes his cue from the white.\\n\\nOf course a black woman is never the wife of the upper class Negro in the North. This state of affairs does not obtain in the South, however. I have noted numerous cases where the wife was considerably darker than the husband. People of some substance, too.\\n\\nThis scornful attitude towards black women receives mouth sanction by the mud-sills.\\n\\nEven on the works and in the Jooks the black man sings disparagingly of black women. They say that she is evil. That she sleeps with her fists doubled up and ready for action. All over they are making a little drama of waking up a yaller wife and a black one.\\n\\nA man is lying beside his yaller wife and wakes her up. She says to him, \"Darling, do you know what I was dreaming when you woke me up?\" He says, \"No honey, what was you dreaming?\" She says, \"I dreamt I had done cooked you a big, fine dinner and we was setting down to eat out de same plate and I was setting on yo\\' lap jus huggin you and kissin you and you was so sweet.\"\\n\\nWake up a black woman, and before you kin git any sense into her she be done up and lammed you over the head four or five times. When you git her quiet she\\'ll say, \"Nigger, know whut I was dreamin when you woke me up?\"\\n\\nYou say, \"No honey, what was you dreamin?\" She says, \"I dreamt you shook yo\\' rusty fist under my nose and I split yo\\' head open wid a axe.\"\\n\\nBut in spite of disparaging fictitious drama, in real life the black girl is drawing on his account at the commissary. Down in the Cypress Swamp as he swings his axe he chants:\\n\\n\"Dat ole black gal, she keep on grumblin,\\nNew pair shoes, new pair shoes,\\nI\\'m goint to buy her shoes and stockings\\nSlippers too, slippers too.\"\\n\\nThen adds aside : \"Blacker de berry, sweeter de juice.\"\\n\\nTo be sure the black gal is still in power, men are still cutting and shooting their way to her pillow. To the queen of the Jook!\\n\\nSpeaking of the influence of the Jook, I noted that Mae West in \"Sex\" had much more flavor of the turpentine quarters than she did of the white bawd. I know that the piece she played on the piano is a very old Jook composition. \"Honey let yo\\' drawers hang low\" had been played and sung in every Jook in the South for at least thirty-five years. It has always puzzled me why she thought it likely to be played in a Canadian bawdy house.\\n\\nSpeaking of the use of Negro material by white performers, it is astonishing that so many are trying it, and I have never seen one yet entirely realistic. They often have all the elements of the song, dance, or expression, but they are misplaced or distorted by the accent falling on the wrong element. Every one seems to think that the Negro is easily imitated when nothing is further from the truth. Without exception I wonder why the black-face comedians are black-face; it is a puzzle--good comedians, but darn poor niggers. Gershwin and the other \"Negro\" rhapsodists come under this same axe. Just about as Negro as caviar or Ann Pennington\\'s athletic Black Bottom. When the Negroes who knew the Black Bottom in its cradle saw the Broadway version they asked each other, \"Is you learnt dat new Black Bottom yet?\" Proof that it was not their dance.\\n\\nAnd God only knows what the world has suffered from the white damsels who try to sing Blues.\\n\\nThe Negroes themselves have sinned also in this respect. In spite of the goings up and down on the earth, from the original Fisk Jubilee Singers down to the present, there has been no genuine presentation of Negro songs to white audiences. The spirituals that have been sung around the world are Negroid to be sure, but so full of musicians\\' tricks that Negro congregations are highly entertained when they hear their old songs so changed. They never use the new style songs, and these are never heard unless perchance some daughter or son has been off to college and returns with one of the old songs with its face lifted, so to speak.\\n\\nI am of the opinion that this trick style of delivery was originated by the Fisk Singers; Tuskeegee and Hampton followed suit and have helped spread this misconception of Negro spirituals. This Glee Club style has gone on so long and become so fixed among concert singers that it is considered quite authentic. But I say again, that not one concert singer in the world is singing the songs as the Negro song-makers sing them.\\n\\nIf anyone wishes to prove the truth of this let him step into some unfashionable Negro church and hear for himself.\\n\\nTo those who want to institute the Negro theatre, let me say it is already established. It is lacking in wealth, so it is not seen in the high places. A creature with a white head and Negro feet struts the Metropolitan boards. The real Negro theatre is in the Jooks and the cabarets. Self-conscious individuals may turn away the eye and say, \"Let us search elsewhere for our dramatic art.\" Let \\'em search. They certainly won\\'t find it. Butter Beans and Susie, Bo-Jangles and Snake Hips are the only performers of the real Negro school it has ever been my pleasure to behold in New York.\\n\\n[Dialect]\\n\\nIf we are to believe the majority of writers of Negro dialect and the burnt-cork artists, Negro speech is a weird thing, full of \"ams\" and \"Ises.\" Fortunately we don\\'t have to believe them. We may go directly to the Negro and let him speak for himself.\\n\\nI know that I run the risk of being damned as an infidel for declaring that nowhere can be found the Negro who asks \"am it?\" nor yet his brother who announces \"Ise uh gwinter.\" He exists only for a certain type of writers and performers.\\n\\nVery few Negroes, educated or not, use a clear clipped \"I.\" It verges more or less upon \"Ah.\" I think the lip form is responsible for this to a great extent. By experiment the reader will find that a sharp \"i\" is very much easier with a thin taut lip than with a full soft lip. Like tightening violin strings.\\n\\nIf one listens closely one will note too that a word is slurred in one position in the sentence but clearly pronounced in another. This is particularly true of the pronouns. A pronoun as a subject is likely to be clearly enunciated, but slurred as an object. For example: \"You better not let me ketch yuh.\"\\n\\nThere is a tendency in some localities to add the \"h\" to \"it\" and pronounce it \"hit.\" Probably a vestige of old English. In some localities \"if \" is \"ef.\"\\n\\nIn story telling \"so\" is universally the connective. It is used even as an introductory word, at the very beginning of a story. In religious expression \"and\" is used. The trend in stories is to state conclusions; in religion, to enumerate.\\n\\nI am mentioning only the most general rules in dialect because there are so many quirks that belong only to certain localities that nothing less than a volume would be adequate.\\n\\nNow He told me, He said, \"You got the three witnesses. One is water, one is spirit, and one is blood. And these three correspond with the three in heben--Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\"\\n\\nNow I ast Him about this lyin in sin and He give me a handful of seed and He tole me to sow \\'em in a bed and He tole me: \"I want you to watch them seeds.\" The seeds come up about in places and He said: \"Those seeds that come up, they died in the heart of the earth and quickened and come up and brought forth fruit. But those seeds that didn\\'t come up, they died in the heart of the earth and rottenend.\\n\\n\"And a soul that dies and quickens through my spirit they will live forever, but those that dont never pray, they are lost forever.

Jessie Jefferson)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy', \"[Verse 1]\\nYou had it all\\nThe day you told me, told me you want me\\nI had it all\\nBut let you fool me, fool me completely\\nYeah, I was so stupid
